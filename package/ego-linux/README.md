# ego-browser, Linux port

Upstream ego lite runs on macOS only: the browser ships as a `.dmg`, and the
`ego-browser` harness talks to it through native bindings the app injects as
`globalThis.ego`.

This package supplies that object on Linux, backed by a stock Chromium over CDP.
**The harness itself is unmodified** — every helper, locator, driver and format
in `package/ego-browser/` is upstream code running as-is.

## Install

Requires Node >= 22 and any Chrome/Chromium/Brave/Edge build on `PATH`.

```bash
cd package/ego-browser && CI=true npm ci && npm run build   # build the upstream harness
cd ../ego-linux && npm test                                  # verify the port (headless)
```

`CI=true` is required, not cosmetic: the harness's `prepare` script runs
`lefthook install`, which fails on any machine with a global `core.hooksPath`
set. The script's own guard is `[ "$CI" = "true" ] && exit 0`, so this is
upstream's intended escape hatch rather than a workaround.

Put the CLI on your PATH:

```bash
ln -s "$PWD/bin/ego-browser.mjs" ~/.local/bin/ego-browser
```

## Use

Identical to upstream — a heredoc of JS on stdin:

```bash
ego-browser <<'JS'
const task = await taskSpaces.useOrCreate('research task')
await page.goto('https://example.com')
console.log(await page.snapshot())
JS
```

Linux-only commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ego-browser --status` | connection state of the backing browser |
| `ego-browser --open` | open the shared agent browser window |
| `ego-browser --spaces` | open the Spaces overview panel |
| `ego-browser --stop` | terminate the backing browser and clear its profile lock |
| `ego-browser --import-chrome-profile` | copy your real Chrome profile in, so agent tasks inherit your logins |
| `ego-browser --install-desktop-entry` | add it to your app launcher, with an icon |
| `ego-browser --headless` | run the backing browser headless (first launch only) |

### The Spaces panel

`ego-browser --spaces` opens an overview of every task space: one card each, with
a live screenshot of the space's page, its name, its owner, and its tab count.
Clicking a card switches to that space, `×` closes it, `+` creates one.

Upstream draws this inside the browser's own chrome, replacing the tab strip.
That is not reachable from outside a Chromium fork — Chrome 137 removed the
`--load-extension` switch, and the CDP `Extensions` domain answers
"Method not available", so nothing can inject UI into the browser frame. (A
Chromium-based browser that still honours `--load-extension`, such as Brave,
*can* load one — verified on this machine — which would additionally allow
native tab groups as space markers.)

What is reachable on stock Chrome is an `--app` window: no tab strip, no
toolbar, its own `app_id`. That is what the panel uses, so it reads as part of
the browser rather than a web page in a tab. A small loopback HTTP server backs
it, reading and writing the same task-space state file the CLI uses — the
overview and the agent can never disagree about which spaces exist.

### App launcher entry

The macOS build installs as an app you click to open. `--install-desktop-entry`
gives the Linux port the same affordance — an XDG desktop entry plus a scalable
icon:

```bash
ego-browser --install-desktop-entry
```

It writes `~/.local/share/applications/ego-lite-linux.desktop` and
`~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/ego-lite-linux.svg`, then refreshes
the desktop and icon caches. Launching it runs `--open`, which brings up the
shared agent browser window. The icon is upstream's mark with a badge, so a
Linux-port window is never mistaken for an upstream build.

The entry pins the **absolute path of the node that installed it**, rather than
relying on a `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang. A desktop session's PATH is not your
shell's, so a node from nvm / fnm / asdf is invisible to it and clicking the
icon would fail silently, with no terminal to show the error. Re-run
`--install-desktop-entry` after switching node versions.

`--open` also replaces a headless backing browser with a visible one instead of
refusing, for the same reason: an icon has to work, not explain.

The backing browser is launched once and **persists between invocations** — each
heredoc is its own short-lived Node process, so the browser, not the process, is
what has to survive. It uses a dedicated profile under
`~/.local/share/ego-lite-linux/profile`, which is why `--import-chrome-profile`
exists: it is the Linux equivalent of ego lite's "migrate your Chrome data"
onboarding step.

Environment overrides: `EGO_LINUX_CHROME` (browser binary),
`EGO_LINUX_PROFILE` (profile dir), `EGO_LINUX_CDP_URL` (attach to an
already-running DevTools endpoint instead of launching), `EGO_LINUX_CURSOR=0`
(hide the agent cursor), `EGO_LINUX_CURSOR_NAME` (rename it from "Claude").

### The agent's cursor

Watch the agent's window and you see a cursor move, click and carry a label of
what it is currently doing — the same "something else is driving this" signal
the native app draws over its web view. On Linux the page is the only surface
the shim controls, so the cursor is a DOM overlay injected into the page the
harness is acting on (`src/cursor.mjs`), fed by the pointer coordinates the
harness sends.

It is deliberately unable to interfere with the automation it illustrates:

- the host element is `pointer-events: none`, so `document.elementFromPoint`
  never returns it. That is load-bearing, not cosmetic — the harness's wheel and
  drag fallbacks hit-test with `elementFromPoint`, and an overlay that answered
  those probes would swallow input meant for the page;
- it lives in a closed shadow root, keeping it out of the agent's own snapshot
  and out of reach of page CSS;
- every render is fire-and-forget and swallows its errors, so a page that
  refuses the injection or navigates mid-flight can never fail an action.

It *is* drawn into screenshots, which is usually what you want and occasionally
not: `EGO_LINUX_CURSOR=0` turns it off.

### The highlighter

`ego` is a global inside a heredoc, so the port adds one thing the upstream API
has no equivalent for — a marker the agent draws to show you what it is talking
about:

```js
await ego.highlight('free shipping', { note: 'this is the bit that changed' })
await ego.highlight('#total', { note: 'and this is the total' })
await ego.clearHighlight()
```

A string is tried as a CSS selector first and searched for as page text if that
finds nothing, so both forms above do the obvious thing; `{selector}` or `{text}`
forces one. Off-screen text is scrolled into view first — a marker nobody can see
explains nothing.

It resolves to a `Range`, which is what gives **one band per line** instead of
one box around a whole paragraph: the difference between a pen stroke and a
coloured rectangle. Each band wipes in from its own left edge while the cursor
travels along it, and the call resolves when the stroke finishes, so an agent can
narrate at the speed a human reads.

It never makes a real selection. Selecting text for the look of it would fight
the agent's own work on the page.

### What the launcher normalises, and why

Two settings are forced on the agent profile because inheriting them silently
breaks coordinate-based automation:

- **Page zoom is reset to 100% on every launch.** `--import-chrome-profile`
  copies real Chrome preferences, zoom included. At 150% zoom a 1280px window
  lays out as 853 CSS px, so page content the agent expects on screen falls
  below the fold: element coordinates hit-test to nothing, clicks land on
  nothing, and `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` can hang outright. This was not
  theoretical — it caused every canvas drawing case in the upstream e2e suite to
  fail until it was fixed.
- **The window is launched at 1280x900 with device scale factor 1**, so page
  layout does not depend on the desktop's HiDPI setting.

The launcher also clears Chrome's `SingletonLock` before starting. A browser
killed without a clean shutdown leaves that lock, and every later launch then
aborts with "Failed to create a ProcessSingleton". Since `launch()` only runs
after no DevTools endpoint answered, a lock still held by a live process means
an unreachable orphan of ours, which is terminated first.

## Fidelity

The harness uses 15 native methods plus 2 callbacks. All are implemented; two
areas are degraded, and both degradations are structural rather than unfinished
work.

| Native surface | Backed by | Fidelity |
|---|---|---|
| `sendCDPMessage`, `onCDPMessage`, `onSendCDPMessageError` | WebSocket to Chrome's browser endpoint | **Exact.** Chrome's flat CDP wire format is byte-identical to what the harness sends and parses, so this is a passthrough, not a translation. |
| `listTabs`, `createTab` | `Target.getTargets` / `Target.createTarget` | **Exact**, except `active`: CDP cannot report which tab is focused, so the DevTools HTTP endpoint's most-recently-used ordering stands in. It also tracks tabs the user switches to by hand. |
| `getBrowserVersion` | `Browser.getVersion` | Exact. |
| `upgradeBrowser` | no-op | App lifecycle; the user's own Chrome updates itself. |
| `animationHighlightMouseToPosition`, `setAgentTaskState` | a DOM overlay injected into the page | **Equivalent, drawn elsewhere.** The native app paints the cursor over its web view; the shim has only the page, so it injects one there. See above. |
| `snapshot` | `DOMSnapshot.captureSnapshot` + role/name computation | **Refs exact, content rebuilt.** See below. |
| the 9 task-space methods | a seeded browser context per space | **Isolated, with inherited logins.** The seeded jar is a copy, not live shared state. See below. |

Verified against upstream's own real-browser e2e suite (45 cases, ~525
assertions), which drives this CLI exactly as it drives the macOS app.

### snapshot

The `refs` half is exact. `browserSnapshotRefsToRefMap()` keys the ref map by
`String(backendNodeId)`, and CDP hands out `backendNodeId`s directly — so `@N`
and `ref=N` resolve against genuine node identities, not a reimplementation.

The `content` half is rebuilt, since the native snapshot is closed source. One
`DOMSnapshot.captureSnapshot` call returns every document — iframes included,
nested to any depth — with each node's `backendNodeId`, attributes and layout
box. Hierarchy, layout-driven visibility and iframe piercing therefore come from
the browser itself; roles, accessible names and `loc=` locators are computed
here. Emitted `loc=` values are resolved by upstream's own `locator-query.ts`,
so they are validated against the real resolver rather than an invented format.

Not claimed: parity with the native snapshot's output. It is a different tree
built from the same underlying facts.

### Task spaces

A native Space is isolated *and* inherits your login state. On stock Chromium
those two properties look like they pull apart:

- `Target.createBrowserContext` → real isolation, but an empty cookie jar
- a separate window → your real logins, but no isolation

They don't, because the empty jar can be filled. A space now owns a browser
context that is seeded from the default jar when the space is created, so it
gets both: cookies written in one space are invisible in every other and in the
default jar, while the logins you already had are there from the start. Closing
the space disposes the context, which drops that jar with it. Measurements and
two reproducible experiments are in
[`docs/isolation-with-inherited-logins.md`](../../docs/isolation-with-inherited-logins.md);
seeding a real 2038-cookie profile costs ~105 ms, once per space.

What this is *not* is live shared state: the seeded jar is a point-in-time copy,
so logging into a site inside one space does not appear in the others, and
`localStorage`, IndexedDB and service workers are not carried at all — a site
holding its token outside cookies will still land logged out.

A space also owns a tracked set of tabs plus its ownership state (`agent` /
`agentDelegatedToUser` / `user`), with working `switch` / `claim` / `handOff` /
`takeOver` / `complete` semantics; switching to a space puts the agent back on
that space's page. A space that cannot get a context, and any space created
before contexts existed, falls back to the window-only behaviour described
below.

`listTabs` is scoped to the selected space, as it is in the native app. That was
dropped once and has been restored, because the reason it failed is gone:
membership used to be inferred from which window a tab landed in, and
`Target.createTarget` accepts no window id, so every heuristic tried (MRU
ordering, "the tab the harness is attached to", "the tab we just created")
either hid a tab the harness still held — `switchTab` then failed with "target
not found" — or leaked one space's tabs into another's list. A context answers
the question outright: `Target.getTargets` reports each target's
`browserContextId`, and a tab opened for a space is created in that context.
Spaces without one fall back to their tracked target ids.

A context-backed space **does** get its own browser window, not by choice: a
target in a non-default context cannot share a window with the default one. That
reverses the earlier design, which deliberately used a single window because
headless Chrome does not render tabs in background windows —
`document.elementFromPoint` returned null there, which broke hit-testing and
tripped the harness's input fallback (`driver/pointer.ts` `finishDragProbe`)
into re-synthesising drags that had already landed, so the canvas cases failed
or counted double strokes. Re-measured with contexts in place: 43/45, all three
canvas cases passing. That flake is load-sensitive, so one clean run is evidence
rather than proof — but contexts did not obviously bring it back.

**What does not work:**

- *Live shared login state.* The seeded jar is a point-in-time copy, so logging
  into a site inside one space does not appear in the others.
- *Storage beyond cookies.* `localStorage`, IndexedDB and service workers are
  not seeded, so a site holding its token outside cookies lands logged out.

Ownership is advisory here. The native bridge enforces the user-control boundary
inside the app; nothing on Linux can stop an agent from driving a window the
user has taken over, so `EGO_TASK_SPACE_USER_IN_CONTROL` is never raised.

## Verification

Two suites, and they must be run one at a time — both drive a browser.

**`npm test` (this package)** drives the real CLI headless against a local
fixture: navigation, snapshot content, refs resolving to coordinates,
synthesised clicks landing on elements, locator fills, two-level iframe
piercing, screenshots, the agent cursor, and task-space lifecycle. It also
starts a real Spaces server and asserts its routes, its cross-origin refusal,
and that a click by a separate agent process shows up as activity on the card.
It uses a throwaway profile and state dir, so it never touches a browser your
agent sessions are using.

**Upstream's real-browser e2e suite** (`cd ../ego-browser && npm run e2e`, with
`ego-browser` on PATH) is the real measure: 45 cases, ~520 assertions, driving
this CLI exactly as it drives the macOS app.

**43 of 45 cases pass** on an unloaded machine.

Two failures are permanent, and neither is a port defect:

| Case | Why it cannot pass |
|---|---|
| `macOS bare Meta input isolation` | Asserts `process.platform === "darwin"`. |
| `regression PWB-10 permission capability` | Asserts that `Browser.grantPermissions` with `clipboardReadWrite` is *rejected* — an ego lite limitation. Stock Chromium supports it, so the port is more capable than the assertion allows. |

Everything else passes: navigation, observation, task spaces, pointer input,
keyboard, downloads, screencast, fetch, canvas drawing, the Playwright
regression set, and the adversarial cases.

### Known flake: canvas drawing under load

The three canvas cases intermittently count one stroke too many
(`expected 1, got 2`). This is a timing race in the *upstream* harness, not in
the shim, and it is worth knowing about because it can bite any drag-heavy work:

`driver/pointer.ts` `finishDragProbe` waits **50 ms** for a trusted `mouseup` on
the drag's end element. If it has not seen one by then, it assumes the real
input never landed and re-synthesises the entire drag in JavaScript. When the
real events did land but arrived late, the page gets both — one trusted drag and
one synthetic one.

Anything that adds latency trips it. Running the screencast case immediately
before the canvas cases reproduces it reliably (drag time goes from ~1.2 s to
~4.1 s), and so does general machine load. The same code, unchanged, produced
six clean runs in a row and later four failing ones on the same box, so the
outcome tracks the machine rather than the port.

Fixing it properly means raising that 50 ms window or making the fallback
conditional on evidence the input actually failed — a change to
`package/ego-browser`, which this port deliberately leaves untouched. Nothing in
the shim layer can suppress the fallback without also removing
`sendCDPMessage`, which everything else depends on.
