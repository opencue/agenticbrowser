# ego-browser

ego-browser gives AI agents a CLI-accessible Node.js runtime with a Playwright-style
API — `page`, `browser`, `taskSpaces`, `site`, `fetch`, `cdp` — that agents call
directly inside JS scripts to observe pages, interact with UI, evaluate browser-side
JavaScript, and drive a real browser for any web automation task.

For setup, install, or connection problems, read `references/install.md`.

Use the `Bash` tool to run all browser operations via `ego-browser nodejs <<'EOF' ... EOF` heredoc. Do not write code to a `.js` file first.

## Prerequisites

Install-time only — skip if `ego-browser` already answers. Setup is in `references/install.md`.

- `ego-browser` — the CLI itself, symlinked from `package/ego-linux/bin/ego-browser.mjs`
- `node` >= 22 — runs both the harness build and each heredoc
- `google-chrome`, `chromium`, or any Chrome/Brave/Edge build on PATH — the browser the port drives over CDP

## Quick start

```bash
ego-browser nodejs <<'EOF'
// Name the task space for the whole user task, then reuse that space across heredoc rounds.
const task = await taskSpaces.useOrCreate('inspect example page')
console.log('task space id: ' + task.id)

await page.goto('https://example.com', { waitUntil: 'load' })

console.log(await page.snapshot())
EOF
```

The heredoc body runs as a Node.js script that controls the selected ego-browser task space. The API objects are preloaded into that script — do not import anything.

## API surface

Everything hangs off six preloaded globals. There are **no flat helper functions**:
`snapshotText()`, `click()`, `fillInput()`, `cliLog()` and friends were removed from
the harness, and calling one raises `ReferenceError: … is not defined`.

| Global | Members |
|---|---|
| `page` | `goto`, `reload`, `info`, `url`, `title`, `snapshot`, `snapshotRaw`, `screenshot`, `evaluate`, `locator`, `getByRole`, `getByText`, `getByLabel`, `getByPlaceholder`, `getByAltText`, `getByTitle`, `getByTestId`, `waitForTimeout`, `waitForLoadState`, `waitForSelector`, `waitForFunction`, `waitForURL`, `waitForRequest`, `waitForResponse`, `waitForEvent`, `setDefaultTimeout`, `elementCenter`, `drainEvents`, `screencast`, `keyboard`, `mouse` |
| `browser` | `listTabs`, `currentTab`, `switchTab`, `openOrReuseTab`, `closeTab`, `ensureRealTab`, `iframeTarget` |
| `taskSpaces` | `useOrCreate`, `list`, `switch`, `new`, `claim`, `complete`, `handOff`, `takeOver`, `waitForAgentControl` |
| `site` | `skills`, `skillsForUrl`, `runTool`, `runBrowserTool`, `learnContext` |
| `fetch` | `fetch.server(url, options)` (Node-side), `fetch.browser(url, options)` (page origin) |
| `cdp` | `cdp(method, params, sessionId?)` — raw CDP for anything the facades don't cover |

Notes:
- `console.log(value)` is the output channel — it is routed to the terminal sink. There is no `cliLog`.
- `await page.info()` — resolves to `{ url, title, w, h, sx, sy, pw, ph }`; if a native browser dialog is open it resolves to `{ dialog: ... }` instead, because page JavaScript is blocked.
- If `await page.info()` resolves to `{ dialog: ... }`, handle it with `await cdp('Page.handleJavaScriptDialog', { accept: true })` before running page JavaScript.
- `await page.url()` is **async** — always await it before using the string.
- `await browser.ensureRealTab()` — switches to an existing non-internal page tab if needed and resolves to it; resolves to `null` when none exists. It does not create a tab — use `await browser.openOrReuseTab(...)` for that.
- `await browser.closeTab(target?)` — closes the given target id / tab object, or the current tab when omitted.
- `await page.drainEvents()` — consumes and returns the async event queue produced by the page.
- `help()` prints the built-in reference; `console.log(help())` is the fastest way to re-check a signature.

### Locators

`page.locator(selector)` returns a strict, auto-waiting locator. It accepts raw CSS,
`xpath=…`, `@N` / `ref=N`, and the `loc=…` values printed by `page.snapshot()`
(`loc=css:…`, `loc=role:…`, `loc=href:…`). `@N` refs work in locators only — they are
not valid inside `document.querySelector(...)`.

Locator methods: `first`, `last`, `nth`, `locator`, `getByRole`, `getByText`,
`getByLabel`, `getByPlaceholder`, `getByAltText`, `getByTitle`, `getByTestId`,
`filter`, `click`, `dblclick`, `hover`, `dragTo`, `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded`, `focus`,
`fill`, `clear`, `press`, `pressSequentially`, `check`, `uncheck`, `setChecked`,
`selectOption`, `setInputFiles`, `dispatchEvent`, `blur`, `textContent`, `innerText`,
`innerHTML`, `inputValue`, `isChecked`, `isVisible`, `isHidden`, `isEnabled`,
`isDisabled`, `isEditable`, `getAttribute`, `boundingBox`, `screenshot`, `count`,
`allInnerTexts`, `allTextContents`, `evaluate`, `evaluateAll`, `waitFor`.

```js
await page.locator('@21').click()
await page.locator('button.primary').click()
await page.locator('loc=role:textbox[name="Search"]').fill('ego lite')
await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Learn more' }).click()
await page.locator('input[type="file"]').setInputFiles('/absolute/path/to/file.pdf')
```

Narrow multiple matches with `filter()`; reach for `first()` / `nth()` only for
confirmed legitimate duplicates.

### Scroll / mouse / keyboard

```js
// scroll an element into view
await page.locator('@42').scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()

// real wheel event, and raw coordinate input (CSS pixels)
await page.mouse.wheel(0, 900)
await page.mouse.click(420, 260)
await page.mouse.drag(from, to)

await page.keyboard.press('Enter')
await page.keyboard.type('hello')
await page.keyboard.insertText('pasted text')
```

`page.mouse` has `click`, `dblclick`, `move`, `down`, `up`, `wheel`, `drag`;
`page.keyboard` has `press`, `down`, `up`, `insertText`, `type`.

### page.evaluate

`page.evaluate` accepts an expression string or a function, and returns the real
value — not a JSON string. A top-level `return` in a string is auto-wrapped.

```js
const data = await page.evaluate(String.raw`(() => {
  const items = [...document.querySelectorAll('article')]
  return items.map(el => ({
    text: el.innerText,
    links: [...el.querySelectorAll('a')].map(a => a.href),
  }))
})()`)
```

When you need multi-step logic inside the browser, wrap it in a single self-invoking
closure and return once — don't split it across several `page.evaluate` calls. Note
that a function passed here is stringified, so closures are not captured.

### Task spaces

A task space is an **isolated browsing context** that ego-browser provides for AI Agents. Each task space has its own set of tabs but **inherits the current user's login state** by default, so Agents can operate on authenticated sites without competing with or disturbing the user's normal browser windows.

Closing all tabs in a task space is equivalent to closing that task space.

A task often takes multiple heredoc rounds to complete. Because the Node.js runtime exits after each heredoc and retains no state, normal working heredocs should start with an explicit call to `taskSpaces.useOrCreate(nameOrId)` to reuse the same space — this lets you operate continuously and reuse tabs across rounds. The exception is resuming after a handoff: once the user confirms "continue" (through an Ask or in chat), start the next heredoc with `taskSpaces.takeOver(nameOrId)` instead.

`nameOrId` can be a task space name, numeric id, or digit-only numeric id string. String values match `name`/`taskId` first, then digit-only strings fall back to numeric id. Number values match existing numeric ids only; if no matching id exists, `taskSpaces.useOrCreate` fails instead of creating a new space.

Use a short name for the active user goal when creating a new task space. Keep reusing that task space for follow-up questions, corrections, refinements, re-checks, and result validation, even if you previously thought the task was complete. Choose a new task space only when the user clearly starts a separate, unrelated goal. Prefer using the numeric `id` returned by `taskSpaces.useOrCreate` (for example, `task.id`) to resume a known task in later rounds and avoid name collisions.

For any follow-up on the same user goal — including continue, corrections, retries, validation, user-reported problems, or work after `taskSpaces.complete(..., { keep: true })` — resume the original task space first if it still exists. Do not create a new task space for the same goal unless the user asks for a fresh space, starts an unrelated goal, or the original space is unavailable after checking. If a new space is necessary, state why.

After explicit user confirmation, to continue work from an existing user-owned, inactive, or unassigned task space, use `await taskSpaces.list()` to find the space, call `await taskSpaces.claim(id)` to take ownership and select it, then use `await browser.listTabs()` and `await browser.switchTab(targetId)` to select the exact tab before acting.

**Ownership policy** — every task space has `ownership: 'agent' | 'agentDelegatedToUser' | 'user'`; the facades treat user-owned spaces differently:

| Call | When the target space is user-owned |
|---|---|
| `taskSpaces.switch` | throws — agent-owned spaces only |
| `taskSpaces.claim` | claims it (ownership transfers to the agent), then selects it |
| `taskSpaces.handOff` | skipped — resolves `{ done: false, skipped: 'user-owned' }` |
| `taskSpaces.complete(…, { keep: true })` | skipped — resolves `{ done: false, skipped: 'user-owned' }` |
| `taskSpaces.complete(…, { keep: false })` | claims it, then closes it |
| `taskSpaces.takeOver` / `waitForAgentControl` | no ownership check |

`taskSpaces.handOff` and `taskSpaces.complete` resolve `{ done: true }` when the operation actually happened. Check `done` before telling the user the handoff/cleanup is finished — a `skipped` result usually means you targeted a space that was never yours.

**`taskSpaces.complete(nameOrId, { keep })` must occupy its own dedicated final heredoc, and run only after a prior heredoc's output has confirmed the task is genuinely done.** `keep` is required and defaults by policy to `false`: close the task space after completion unless there is a concrete reason to leave the live page visible.

Use `{ keep: true }` only when the user explicitly asks to keep the page open, the task needs manual user action in that exact page, or the result cannot be delivered well as a URL, file, artifact, or summary. Do not keep a task space open merely because a page was visited, a document was created, or a screenshot was used for verification.

When passing a string that may create a new task space, the string should reflect the task's intent (e.g. `'search github issues'`); don't use literal placeholders.

**If the task space needs to be preserved after the task ends, keep only the tabs that need to be shown to the user.** Keep loose awareness of how many tabs are open — a quick `(await browser.listTabs()).length` is enough; there's no need to spend a dedicated round just to check. When scratch tabs (search-result pages, cross-check pages, and other one-off pages) pile up, close them as you go rather than letting them all accumulate for the end. When finishing with `{ keep: true }` to leave pages for the user, clear out the remaining scratch tabs so only the pages worth showing stay open. Close a single tab with `await browser.closeTab(targetId)` (`targetId` comes from `browser.listTabs()` or an `openOrReuseTab` return value).

**Linux port caveat**: `browser.listTabs()` lists tabs across the whole browser, not just the selected task space, so filter by the space's `targetIds` when you need per-space tabs. It resolves to a plain **array** of `{ targetId, title, url, active, index }` — not an object with a `tabs` key — so `(await browser.listTabs()).length` is the tab count.

### Control handoff

Only one side — agent or user — holds control of a task space at any time. While the user holds control, any browser operation by the agent fails with a "user is controlling" message — do not retry it; follow the steps below to resume.

A "user is controlling" error is a hard stop on the whole task — not an obstacle to route around. It means the user has deliberately taken the browser back, often because your current approach is going wrong. Honoring it *is* the correct outcome here; pushing the goal forward anyway is the failure. The only thing you may do is **ask the user and wait**.

An "inactive", "not assigned to an agent", or similar task-space error is also a hard stop with the same confirmation requirement. Resume only after explicit user confirmation, then start with `await taskSpaces.claim(id)`.

**Handing off**: When the task requires user intervention (e.g. login, captcha, manual confirmation), call `await taskSpaces.handOff(nameOrId)` to give control to the user, and tell them exactly what to do. Omitting `nameOrId` uses the currently selected task space; pass `task.id` across heredoc rounds to avoid ambiguity.

**Regaining control**: Take control back *only* after the user explicitly confirms — through an Ask (your harness's button/option prompt, e.g. "Continue" vs "Finish task") or a "continue" message in chat. Then start a new heredoc with `await taskSpaces.takeOver(nameOrId)` and resume; if the user chooses to finish, close out with `await taskSpaces.complete(nameOrId, { keep })`. Never call `taskSpaces.takeOver` on your own to grab control back — it has no ownership check and will seize the browser away from the user.

**Unexpected takeover**: The user can take over at any time via the browser GUI — the same effect as the agent calling `taskSpaces.handOff`. Do not retry the failed operation and do not auto-takeover; surface the Ask above (Continue / Finish) and resume only when the user picks Continue.

`await taskSpaces.waitForAgentControl(nameOrId)` is a read-only blocking poll (it never takes control); use it only to wait inside the current heredoc for a handoff you initiated.

## Recommended workflow

ego-browser has three main workflows. Pick the workflow that fits the page and task before acting.

Use the semantic workflow first for ordinary websites with real DOM controls. For canvas-like productivity apps and rich editors — including Google Docs, Google Sheets, Lark/Feishu Docs, Notion, Figma, whiteboards, maps, and other virtualized editors — use the visual workflow first for the main editing surface. These apps often expose toolbars, title inputs, hidden textareas, offscreen iframes, or canvas layers in the DOM that do not represent the actual user-editable document or grid. Do not rely on `locator.fill(...)`, DOM selectors, or `page.snapshot()` refs for the main editing surface unless a small write probe proves the text lands in the intended place.

Before writing substantial content into a rich editor, perform a tiny write probe, then verify it with `await page.screenshot()`, an export/readback path, or another reliable visual/state check. If the probe appears in the title bar, toolbar search, hidden input, or any wrong field, stop using DOM/input helpers for that surface and switch to screenshot-guided mouse actions plus real keyboard operations.

1. **Semantic workflow: `page.snapshot()` + refs / locators** — default for most pages with normal text, links, buttons, forms, tables, and lists.
   - Reuse or create a task space: `const task = await taskSpaces.useOrCreate(name)`.
   - Open or switch pages with `await browser.openOrReuseTab(url)`; use `await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'load' })` when navigating inside the current tab.
   - Observe with `await page.snapshot()` to get a full-page semantic tree annotated with `[ref=N, loc=..., url=...]`.
   - Act with `await page.locator('@N').click()`, `await page.locator('@N').fill(...)`, or stable `loc=...` values. Use `page.evaluate` only when it is simpler than a locator.
   - After meaningful clicks, input, or navigation, observe again with `await page.snapshot()`, `await page.info()`, or `await page.screenshot()` before assuming success.

2. **Visual workflow: `await page.screenshot()` + coordinate/keyboard actions** — use when the page is primarily visual, canvas-like, heavily virtualized, or when accessibility / semantic structure is incomplete.
   - Inspect the screenshot, act with viewport coordinates such as `await page.mouse.click(x, y)`, `await page.keyboard.press(...)`, and `await page.keyboard.type(...)`, then verify with another screenshot or a reliable export/readback path.
   - Prefer this path for rich editors, spreadsheets, visual menus, map/canvas UIs, drag interactions, and targets that are obvious visually but poor in the DOM/AX tree.

3. **Direct DOM / CDP workflow: `await page.evaluate(...)` / `await cdp(...)`** — use when you need browser state, compact data extraction, custom DOM traversal, or raw browser capabilities.
   - Keep browser-side logic in one explicit IIFE and return once.
   - Use `await cdp(...)` for browser protocol operations that the facades do not cover.

These workflows can be combined. A task may take multiple heredoc rounds when the next step depends on fresh page state or user handoff. In each round, write a coherent script that advances the task: observe, act or extract, verify, and report with `console.log(...)`. Avoid tiny probe scripts, but don't force the whole task into one oversized script.

## Caveats

- Timeouts are in **milliseconds**, Playwright-style: `await page.waitForTimeout(1500)` waits 1.5 s. (The removed flat API used seconds — do not carry that habit over.)
- `await page.screenshot()` returns a **file path string** (e.g. `/tmp/ego-browser-shot-….png`), not image bytes. Read the file if you need the image.
- `page.snapshot()` defaults to the whole page. Pass `{ scope: 'only_within_viewport' }` only when the task needs visible content alone. Its three output flags all trade tokens for capability, so know the size of the trade before reaching for one. Measured on a real content-heavy page (43k chars at the defaults): `scope: 'only_within_viewport'` −22%, `includeStableLocator: false` −20%, both −37%, and additionally `includeActionMarks: false` −42%. What each costs you: viewport scope drops the refs of everything below the fold (see the next bullet), `includeStableLocator: false` removes the `loc=` values that survive across rounds, and `includeActionMarks: false` removes the annotations telling you what is actionable. Repeatedly snapshotting the same page is better solved by a site skill under `learnings/`, which returns extracted data instead of a tree.
- `@N` refs are only valid for the most recent `page.snapshot()` call — every call rebuilds the refMap. Ref numbers come from the CDP `backendNodeId`, so the same element keeps the same number across calls; but to use `@N`, N must appear in the latest snapshot output. An element scrolled out of the viewport, a DOM re-render, or a previous call with `scope: 'only_within_viewport'` that didn't cover the element will all cause `Unknown ref`. For elements you need long-term, use the `loc=...` value as a stable selector, or write a CSS selector directly.
- `page.evaluate()` returns the evaluated value, not a JSON string — don't wrap it with `JSON.parse(...)`.
- Inside a `page.evaluate` template string, regex backslashes must be doubled (e.g. `\\d`, `\\s`), or use `String.raw`.
- Code in the heredoc body runs in Node.js; code inside `page.evaluate(...)` runs in the browser page. Navigation, waits, and `console.log(...)` belong in the heredoc body; `document`, `window`, and page selectors belong inside `page.evaluate(...)`.
- If `await page.info()` reports `w: 0` or `h: 0`, do not continue coordinate actions or screenshots until the viewport is fixed. Try switching to the real tab, reloading, or using CDP viewport metrics, then verify with `await page.info()` and `await page.screenshot()`.
- Always call `taskSpaces.complete(name, { keep })` when the task is done — do not leave the space hanging. Default to `{ keep: false }`; use `{ keep: true }` only for the concrete live-page cases described in Task spaces.
- When the user explicitly asks to use ego-browser, assume both `ego-browser` and the repo runtime are ready. Do not pre-check `which ego-browser`, `node -v`, package metadata, or help output. Only investigate environment issues if the first run produces an error.
- If the first run reports `command not found` / a missing environment, or the user explicitly asks to install ego lite, read `references/install.md` and follow its flow to complete the install, then return to the original task — do not give up, and do not keep retrying the same heredoc.
